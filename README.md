Using historical daily data on maximum and minimum temperatures, along with relative humidity data, from October through May, can I accurately estimate the amount of total snowfall (in centimeters) that will occur on a given day in those months using a machine learning model? The analysis excludes summer months (June through September) due to their historically negligible snowfall patterns.
